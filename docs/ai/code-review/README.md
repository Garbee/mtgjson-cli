# Code Review Reports

This directory contains code review reports generated by the Security
Reviewer agent. Each report documents security findings, code quality issues,
and recommendations for improvement.

## Report Naming Convention

Reports follow the naming pattern: `[date]-[component]-review.md`

Examples:

* `2026-02-08-api-client-review.md`
* `2026-02-15-authentication-review.md`
* `2026-03-01-data-processor-review.md`

## Report Contents

Each code review report includes:

* **Component Overview**: Description of the reviewed code
* **Security Findings**: Security vulnerabilities and risks identified
* **Code Quality Issues**: Non-security code quality concerns
* **Priority Levels**: Tagged severity/priority for each finding
* **Specific Examples**: Code snippets showing issues and fixes
* **Recommendations**: Actionable steps for remediation

## Review Process

The Security Reviewer agent creates these reports as part of the code review
process. Reports are versioned in Git to track security posture over time.

## Maintenance

* Keep reports organized by date and component
* Archive old reports when components are significantly refactored
* Reference reports in pull requests that address findings
